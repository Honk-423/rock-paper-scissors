# rock-paper-scissors

Hello, I'm Honk. I'm creating yet another project per The Odin Project's curriculum. I'm eager to get back to coding, but I'm also nervous because I haven't worked with JavaScript much. I also have worries about the quality of my commit messages and pseudocode, but I'm determined to improve.

As usual, once I've finished this project I'll talk about what I've learned.
