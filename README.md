# rock-paper-scissors

Hello, I'm Honk. I'm creating yet another project per The Odin Project's curriculum. I'm eager to get back to coding, but I'm also nervous because I haven't worked with JavaScript much. I also have worries about the quality of my commit messages and pseudocode, but I'm determined to improve.

As usual, once I've finished this project I'll talk about what I've learned.

I just finished a few moments ago. The project was very easy in my opinion, but The Odin Project walked me through a lot of it. Now, onto what I've learned:

Pseudocode is incredibly helpful. It's literally just step by step instructions on what to do. I wish I had known to use it sooner.

This took a bit of research, but knowing that parameters can be returned then used in other functions was crucial for this project. I could see myself having to use this constantly.

Comment as you go, not at the end of the project. I waited until the very end to write comments, and while I think they came out decently, it probably would have been easier to do it as I coded. The reasons why I did certain things would have been more fresh in my mind, and it would have just been less tiring doing it one at a time instead of one after the other.

That's everything that I learned this time around, or at least that's everything that I understand how to put into words. This project was very fun and although it was simple, I'm very proud of it.
